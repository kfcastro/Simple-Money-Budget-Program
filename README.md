															My Hobby/Interest: 
	
	Ever since I studied basic accountancy, I have been tracking my budget and be practical on what I spend my money on. Especially as a student, you have limited allowance and you need to budget your money to get through the day/week. It helps me to value things more, at the same time learning about being independent.

																Problem:
	
	Before, I used to write all my expenses on a memo pad. It is sometimes inconvenient to carry around and there are times I forgot my pen or the memo pad itself. Also, production of memo pad or any paper-based product is detrimental to the environment.


***

																Solution:

	
	So, by making this project, I hope that it will be an approach to further my basic accounting abilities and to be mindful of my spending habits. The program will be a hard code only. It will accept following parameters: category (income or expense), expense type (food, transportation, etc.), and amount of money. Then, it will create and write the data to a text file. At the same time, solving for the total budget/money left using the formula income-expense. After that, it will print the updated data. End of Program.

															Requirements:

1. Design Pattern per category:

	1.1 Creational pattern

		Since I’ll be using instances that provides a global point of access to it, it pattern will be similar to Singleton design pattern. Even though, I will be using at least 2 instances, it will still implement a design similar to singleton. I don’t have user input for the code, it’s just ust hard-coded inputs in the main method.


	1.2 Structural patterns

		The structure of my objects will be like the one in Composite Design Pattern and a little bit of Flyweight Pattern. Composite Design Pattern "allow clients to operate in generic manner on objects that may or may not represent a hierarchy of objects". A Flyweight Pattern says that just "to reuse already existing similar kind of objects by storing them and create new object when no matching object is found".


	1.3 Behavioral patterns
	
		Since I just want to solve the daily expense and present all the data, the Iterator Design Pattern is applicable here.


2. Use test-driven development (TDD)
	
		Then, I'll start coding using TDD, first I'll create a test for the creational pattern that I'm going to use. Then run the test, and if it’s failed then I’ll write the code and then run the test again. Then I'll try to see if I can refactor some codes, and then repeat the whole cycle again.


3. Apply the Best Java Coding Practices
	
		While writing the code, I keep in mind of the best practices in coding, like:
		•	Indention
		•	Naming convention
		•	Class Members should be private
		•	Avoid using for loops with indexes, and etc.
		Then, after I've coded everything, I added the remaining documentations needed and revised the code.


4. When everything works, I'll create a video on the steps I did.
	
		Afterwards, I go over my notes of what patterns I used. Then discussed and showed the codes. Then, read some more of my notes to see where in the code I applied best practices, while demonstrating the minimum requirement of 3 TDD cycle. After that, I javadoc my code, created a github account,  made the README.MD,  and summarized the requirements I used. Lastly, upload the javadoc, the source code, and the executable jar file that works. And finally, upload in Youtube my demo. And, send the following links in LMS:

4.1 Github (source code, javadoc output, executable jar)

Note: Please change the file directory in line 137.
